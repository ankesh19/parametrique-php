                    <p>Measure the use of your residential and business resources with 
                        advanced energy management. Strategically orient your needs with the
                        motive of sustainable energy and conservation. Energy efficient systems
                        allow strategizing of energy consumption for effective usage and consumption.
                        Our energy systems assure minimal carbon emissions.
                    </p>
                    <p>Prepaid meter is an essential component of our energy management solutions.
                         With monthly fixed charges based on kVA/kW, the user is charged only on the
                        basis of the specified amount levied. Along with this, there are several 
                        features of the software that goes in the enhancing of the prepaid metering
                        solution. In the case of negative threshold, the meter alerts the user by 
                        generating readable alerts. These alerts are in the form of SMS or Email-alerts
                        that gets stored with the user as a record of the functioning and usage of the 
                        meter.

                <p>Apart from the negative threshold alerts, another type of alert provided by 
                    the meter is to indicate any sort of misuse. During instances of wrongful use, 
                    if detected, the meter is capable of sending alerts to you for better energy 
                    consumption and use.
                </p>
                <p>Another important feature and highlight of prepaid metering is the display of 
                    logo of the service provider, his name and the address of the provider. This 
                    means that the user has the necessary information on everything through which the
                    service is available to him. The software used in the prepaid meter is equipped 
                    with a special feature that helps in generating the electricity bill. This also 
                    helps you to keep a check on the energy consumption.
                </p>
                <p>In case you are unable to maintain the bills properly, the system will help the 
                    user know about it. That is, if the user initiates payment for a bill, which has
                    already been done and eventually completes the payment, the system will automatically
                    reverse the charge and return back the payment. If itâ€™s not a digital transaction,
                    then the option for reconciliation of the cheque is also available.
                </p>
                <p>Any instance of power cut off is well managed with the software. Be it a night time
                    cut off or anything else, the software has the ability to manage it accordingly. 
                    This saves a lot of energy and eventually caters to the essential need of prepaid
                    metering. Providing fully advanced features and capacity, the software activates 
                    itself to provide the reconnection time and keeps you posted about consumption and
                    use. In this way, time management is also carried out along with the needs for energy
                    consumption.
